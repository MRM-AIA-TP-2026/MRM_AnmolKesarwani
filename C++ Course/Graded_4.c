/*Imagine that you have a Turtle object called tina. You want tina to move around on a screen and leave a trail that draws a triangle like below.
Requirements:

    tina must move exactly as shown in the graphic above.
    You must include a for loop.
    You must declare an iterating variable i and initialize it to zero (e.g. int i = 0).
    Your loop header must include i++. In other words, i gets incremented by 1 after each iteration.
    You must include the following two commands in your code:
        tina.left(120);
        tina.forward(100); */

Requirements

    You must include a for or while loop in your code.

    For example, your output should look like this:*/

For example, arguments 5 and 8 will result in a sum of 26 (5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26). If the integer arguments are the same value, the program will simply print that value as the sum.
Requirements

    Declare and initialize a variable to keep tracking of your sum.

    If a and b are the same integers, then print either a or b as the sum.
